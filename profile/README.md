## About

The Food Systems Research Center (FSRC) at the University of Vermont (UVM) is transforming the research landscape by funding collaborative projects that put people and the planet first, break down traditional academic silos and are integrated with and responsive to the needs of the communities we serve, including decision-makers, farmers, and food systems actors. 

Rooted in the belief that no one group can find the answers alone, FSRC empowers researchers to work together across disciplines to address critical issues like soil health, food security, and climate resilience. Instead of funding research that leads to short-term fixes, our commitment is to give researchers the freedom, resources, and time they need to do relevant research that will inform policies, practices, and programs that will long outlast their work. 

FSRC considers the relationship of food systems across scales from local to global and is a partnership between UVM and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Agricultural Research Service (ARS). FSRC’s transdisciplinary approach prioritizes research that studies food systems as a whole, including the networks of people, institutions, physical infrastructure, and natural resources through which food is grown, processed, distributed, sold, prepared, and eaten. 

## Projects

The FSRC is engaged in a variety of endeavors addressing food security, soil health, sustainable dairy, and farmer values, to name just a few. You can learn more about our work at our [website](https://www.uvm.edu/cals/food-systems-research). Currently, what you will find here are a series of repositories related to Sustainability Metrics, a project that is developing a framework to measure the sustainability of the food system of New England. It is a collaboration between five teams of investigators conducting primary research on local and regional food systems. What you will find here are a series of repositories collecting and analyzing secondary data to support this work.

> [!NOTE]
> This project is early in development. The framework, metrics, and analyses are all preliminary.

- [sm-data](https://www.github.com/food-systems-research-center/sm-data): An R project that collects, cleans, and compiles secondary data from a variety of sources.
- [sm-docs](https://www.github.com/food-systems-research-center/sm-docs): A Quarto website that describes the framework, metrics, and preliminary exploratory analyses of secondary data.
- [sm-explorer](https://www.github.com/food-systems-research-center/sm-explorer): A Shiny app providing an interactive exporation of metrics, including spatial data.
